    <h3>Skiing</h3>
    <img src="/images/skier.png" alt="ski mountain" />
    <p>Still relatively new at skiing, I fell in love with it from the start. I first
        tried it when I wanted to learn the basics before taking a big ski trip to Colorado. 
     </p>   
        <p>
        I was hooked from the first descend. After the different experiences of skiing on both the east 
        coast and in Colorado, I wondered what other areas were like. I wanted to try as many different 
        mountains and terrains as I could.
    </p>
    <p>
        Coinciding with my desire to travel and see new places, skiing has given me just that. I look forward
        to all the places skiing will take me!

    <h3>Weightlifting</h3>

    <p>
        I started lifting weights back in my days of grade-school football. What started as an attempt 
        to get stronger quickly became a part of my life.
    </p>
    <p>
        It became a regular part of my routine, even after the days of sports. Focus shifted from getting
        stronger, to just enjoying exercising and trying to stay in good physical shape. In one activity, I can 
        exercise, have time to be by myself, and relieve some stress (if needed).
    </p>
    <p>Weightlifting and going to the gym has given me some of my closest friends. Some I met at the gym, some I got 
        closer to because we dragged each other to go work out when weren't feeling like it.
    </p>
    <p>
        It is an activity that has become a part of me and my routine, and I am thankful for many things that
        come from it.

    <h3>Traveling</h3>
    <img src="/images/st maarten.png" alt="boat view of ocean to the land" />
    <p>There was a day when I realized that even though my family is from India, I had only gone three times, all times 
        when I was very young. That led me to realize I hadn't traveled much at all in the last probably 15 years. That 
        was when I decided I wanted to travel more.
    </p>
    <p>
        I got this opportunity when my best friend was getting married. I took two big trips in the span of 2 months
        and I realized all the new experiences that awaited in all the different places in the world.
        After that, I started to plan a trip to somewhere about once every couple months.
    </p>
    <p>
        I enjoy the new experiences, meeting new people, and learning about new places. I especially love food,
        and travelling has given me the opportunity to try so many new foods. I hope to keep taking these trips
        and gaining all these new experiences!
